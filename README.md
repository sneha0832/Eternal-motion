# ðŸ§¿ Project Title: Eternal Motion Puppet â€“ Lord Vishnu Animation

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
For this project, I animated a character using individual mobile components, applying mathematical motion and interactive logic. I chose to work with a symbolic image of Lord Vishnu, enhancing its spiritual and visual appeal while still aligning with the technical objectives of the assignment.

The animated character consists of over 27 separate mobile components, each isolated and animated using mathematical functions, angle rotations, counters, and loops. All animations were rendered using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript, emphasizing advanced geometric properties like pivotal centers and rotational symmetry.

Each of these parts was extracted and enhanced from a 24-bit transparent PNG, with careful attention to cropping and joint alignment to ensure smooth, natural-looking movement.

## ðŸ§® Mathematical Animation Techniques

1. Each part of the puppet is animated using pure math-based transformations, without relying on physics libraries or timeline-based animation tools. Key techniques used include:
2. Angle oscillation using Math.sin() and Math.cos() for smooth rotations.
3. Incremental counters and angle limits to create repetitive, lifelike motion loops.
4. Pivot point adjustments to ensure rotation happens at the correct anatomical joint (e.g., shoulder, neck).
5. Layered canvas rendering, assigning each body part to a separate quadrant or canvas where needed.

## ðŸ§© Quadrant Canvas Design

To study the puppet geometrically, the characterâ€™s limbs and components were also rendered in separate canvas quadrants for analysis and testing. This helped isolate motion patterns, debug joint behavior, and ensure visual clarity before merging into the main stage.

## âœ… Summary

This project applies mathematical animation principles to bring a symbolic digital puppet of Lord Vishnu to life. It demonstrates mastery in decomposing an image into motion-capable parts, assigning realistic pivot points, and looping eternal motion through math and geometry, all within an interactive, browser-based environment.
